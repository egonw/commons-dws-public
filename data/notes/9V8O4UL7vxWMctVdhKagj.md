Let's see is Thiago's app can help here [[wikidata.apps]]
The idea would be to find a list of paper having described both a metabolites and it's associated BGC


Let's try a SPARQL Query as following :

https://w.wiki/3yN7
detailed https://w.wiki/3yNw 
with single ref https://w.wiki/3yNL
limited to specific strains https://w.wiki/3yPf
