<p>Just accepted a review Editor role for Frontiers in Natural Products.
Hopefully not a mistake ...</p>
<p>The Review Editor: The primary role of the Review Editor is to provide an expert review of Frontiers articles in a rigorous, constructive and efficient manner. Frontiers acknowledges the role of the reviewer by naming the person to the Editorial Board and by publishing the name of the Review Editor on every published paper endorsed by him or her. This practice requires Frontiers to have processes in place to transparently deal with conflicts of interest, both real and perceived.
Frontiers Review Editors should hold, as a minimum, either a PhD with post-doctoral experience, or an equivalent degree with several additional years of academic work, or the equivalent number of years to a recognized qualification in the relevant field of research. Review Editors should have a recognized affiliation and a proven publication record in their specialty area.</p>
