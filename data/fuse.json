We denote by $x_{sm}$ whether metabolite $m=1,\\ldots,M$ is present ($x_{sm}=1$) or absent ($x_{sm}=0$) in species $s=1,\\ldots,S$. To infer the full vector $\\bm{x}=(x_{11}, \\ldots, x_{1M},\\ldots,x_{SM})$, we assume that related species share a similar set of metabolites and that metabolites related in their synthesis share a similar distribution across species. \nLet ${\\mathbb P}(x_{sm}=1|y_{sm})=y_{sm}$ be the probability with which metabolite $m$ is present in species $s$. We then assume that\n\n$$\nlogit \\space y_{sm} = \\mu_m + \\epsilon_{sm}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mu$ is a metabolite-specific intercept and $\\epsilon_{sm}$ is normally distributed with mean 0 and co-variance $cov(\\epsilon_{sm},\\epsilon_{s'm'})=\\alpha \\sigma_{ss'} + \\beta \\sigma_{mm'}$ between each combination of species and metabolite. Here, $\\sigma_{ss'}$ and $\\sigma_{mm'}$ are known measures of covariance between species $s$ and $s'$ and between metabolites $m$ and $m'$, respectively, and $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are positive scalars.\n\nWe consider two sets of data informative about $\\bm{x}$: i) Presence-absence data obtained with mass-spectrometry and ii) presence-only reports of specific metabolites in specific specie. Let $\\bm{d_{sj}}=(d_{sj1}, \\ldots, d_{sjM})$ be the presence-absence vector of each metabolite $m$ obtained with mass-spectrometry run $j=1,\\ldots,J_s$ performed on species $s$. Assuming a false-positive and false-negative error rates $\\epsilon_{01}$ and $\\epsilon_{10}$, respectively, we have\n\n$$\n{\\mathbb P}(\\bm{d_{sj}}|\\bm{x}, \\epsilon_{01}, \\epsilon_{10}) = \\prod_m \\left[ x_{sm}\\left(\\epsilon_{10}^{1-d_{sjm}}(1-\\epsilon_{10})^{d_{sjm}}\\right) + (1-x_{sm})\\left( \\epsilon_{01}^{d_{sjm}}(1-\\epsilon_{01})^{1-d_{sjm}}\\right)\\right].\n$$\n\nTo model the presence only data, it must be put in relation to the expected research effort. Let $p_{sm}$ denote the known number of presence-only reports for metabolite $m$ in species $s$ and $n_{sm}$ the unknown number of research projects that aimed at discovering metabolite $m$ in species $s$. Assuming a false-positive and false-negative error rates $\\pi_{01}$ and $\\pi_{10}$, respectively, we have\n\n$$\n{\\mathbb P}(p_{sm}|n_{sm}, \\pi_{01}, \\pi_{10}) = ...\n$$\n\n### Images\nHere are the first ideas of the discussion we had with Daniel and Pierre-Marie:\n\n![image](assets/images/2023-01-30-14-53-54.jpg)\n\n![image](assets/images/2023-01-30-14-53-55.jpg)\n### Ideas \nSee forum discussion [here](https://github.com/anticipated-lotus/forum/discussions/3)\n* The probability of occurence of a given chemical class (i.e of a pseudo absence being indeed pseudo an not a real absence) could be formulated as the sum of probability of this occurence given the : chemical research effort context, phylogenetic context, covariance of other chemical classes. \n* This last term was discussed: study of the covariance of chemical classes within a given taxa could be informative. \n###\n\n## Doing\n\n## Paused\n\n## Done\nChange `prepare_pseudoabsence_tables.R` in order to have a csv table and not a space separated data. \n\n## Notes\n\"ref/noref, children/nochildren\" mean if you take into account multiple reference (and children) or not.\n\nSo, for example: 2 articles report amarogentin in *Gentiana lutea*, 3 (of which 1 is the same) in *Gentiana acaulis*.\n\nThen, for the pair amarogentin in *Gentiana*:\n* `ref_child` : 5 &rarr; Gives the number of occurences were we find amarogentin related with a *Gentiana* species.\n* `ref_nochild`: 4 &rarr; Gives how many **different** papers there are that talk about amarogentin in the species *Gentiana*\n* `noref_child` : 2 &rarr; Gives how many children of that species were found with at least one reference (in that case : *Gentiana    \n  lutea* and *Gentiana acaulis*)\n* `noref_nochild`: 1 &rarr; Will only be either 0 or 1. Gives if it there is at least one reference that talks about that molecule \n  in the species *Gentiana*\n\n**ATTENTION** tables are grouped also chemically. So child also refers to the \"chemical children\", so exactly same principle as for *Gentiana* and *G. lutea* but this for Terpenoids > Monoterpenoids > Secoiridoids (> Amarogentin)... \n## Todo tomorrow\n\n###\n###\n###\n\n\n## Today I learned that\n\n- ","n":0.042}}},{"i":19,"$":{"0":{"v":"2023-02-09","n":1},"1":{"v":"# This is Marco's daily open-notebook.\n\nToday is 2023.02.09\n\n## Todo today\n\n### Have a look at the DBGI discussion forum\n* https://github.com/orgs/digital-botanical-gardens-initiative/discussions\n\n\n###\n###\n\n## Doing\n* comment code from https://github.com/anticipated-lotus/elotus-trees\n  * `prepare_pseudoabsence_tables.R`\n  * `prettyStructuresTable.R`\n  * `prettyTree.R`\n\n## Paused\n\n## Done\nCommented code from https://github.com/anticipated-lotus/elotus-trees : \n* `count_npclasses.R`\n* `papers_taxa_correlation.R`\n\n## Notes\n### Scripts descrition\nI think the most important script for us is `prepare_pseudoabsence_tables.R`.

Scholia\n\nhttps://github.com/fnielsen/scholia\n\nScholia is a python package and webapp for interaction with scholarly information in Wikidata.\n\nhttps://scholia.toolforge.org/\n\n## Interest of

\n\nhttps://github.com/fnielsen/scholia/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst\n\n\n\n## Egon's footnote \n\nHave you heard about Wikidata already? \"Use Scholia and Wikidata to find scientific literature\" is a new tutorial from my colleague Lauren Dupuis. https://laurendupuis.github.io/Scholia_tutorial/\n\n## Daniels mail\n\nRegarding the use of Scholia for visualizing structure-taxon relationships, I think this is very possible - we already have aspects for chemicals and for taxa, e.g. as per\nhttps://scholia.toolforge.org/taxon/Q157892\nor\nhttps://scholia.toolforge.org/chemical/Q121802 .\n\nWith regards to forks, the most prominent example is probably\nhttps://ordia.toolforge.org/ ,\nwhich visualizes linguistic information based on the lexeme namespace in Wikidata.\n\nAnother thing to think about would be genome browsers like\nhttp://wikigenomes.org/\nor\nhttps://chlambase.org/ .\n\n\nadding additional SPARQL queries to existing Scholia pages is relatively straightforward (the main issue here is performance), so things like adding \"found in taxon\"-based queries to Scholia pages about compounds or taxa and perhaps also pathways could be solved quickly.\n\nWhat might be even more interesting - but would require a bit more work - would be what we call subaspects, i.e. pages that combine two main classes, like https://scholia.toolforge.org/location/Q1748/topic/Q2539 .\n\nWith that in mind, we could think of things like\nhttps://scholia.toolforge.org/compound/QID1/taxon/QID2\nor\nhttps://scholia.toolforge.org/taxon/QID3/compound/QID4 .\n\nThe work on such subaspects has been described in\nhttps://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q50813856 for the example of geodata,\nwhich would probably be a good starting point when considering the effort involved.\n\n\n\n##

Note that DOIs are uppercase-normalized in Wikidata.\n\n## Check for the presence of your compound in Wikidata <a name=\"check_compound\"></a>\n\nUsing the compound's InChIKey (i.e. ```QOVGHDRCAGYGEB-FFZYJECLSA-N``` for trigocherrin A), run a SPARQL query to check if your compound is present in Wikidata or not:\n\n\n```SPARQL\nSELECT ?item ?itemLabel WHERE {\n  VALUES ?classes {\n    wd:Q11173 # chemical compound\n    wd:Q59199015 # group of stereoisomers\n    wd:Q79529 # chemical substance\n    wd:Q17339814 # group of chemical substances\n    wd:Q47154513 # structural class of chemical compounds\n  }\n  ?item wdt:P31 ?classes. # instance of\n  ?item wdt:P235 'QOVGHDRCAGYGEB-FFZYJECLSA-N'\n  SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language \"[AUTO_LANGUAGE],en\". }\n}\n```\n[Try this query](https://w.wiki/32zU). You can adapt it by replacing the InChIKey with the one for your compound.\n\nAlternatively you can use the following Scholia link (replace by your compounds InChIKey) [https://scholia.toolforge.org/inchikey/QOVGHDRCAGYGEB-FFZYJECLSA-N](https://scholia.toolforge.org/inchikey/QOVGHDRCAGYGEB-FFZYJECLSA-N) \n\nIf your compound is already present on Wikidata, you can directly skip to the [Add the biological source information](#add_bio) section below.\n\n## Add your data manually to Wikidata <a name=\"add_your_data_manually\"></a>\n\nFirst, if you do not have a Wikidata account already, it is advisable that you create one via [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:CreateAccount](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:CreateAccount). While an account is not strictly required for manual edits, having one will be useful if you want to contribute more than once, and it helps in getting your contributions recognized. Note that Wikidata accounts are integrated with accounts across the Wikimedia ecosystem, so if you already have an account on, say, any Wikipedia or on Wikispecies, then you can use the same credentials on Wikidata.\n\nIf you are unfamiliar with how Wikidata works, you can start by reading the Wikidata introduction page [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Introduction](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Introduction) and have a look at the Wikidata Tours page [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Tours](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Tours).\n\nNow that you are all set up, you can go to Wikidata's page for creating new items, [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:NewItem](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:NewItem):\n\n\n![](/assets/images/2021-02-25-14-18-03.png)\n\nAn empty page with a new Wikidata identifier is created \n\n![](/assets/images/2021-02-25-14-18-50.png)\n\n### Add the chemical compound information <a name=\"add_chemical\"></a>\n\nCreate a new statement for ```is an instance of```\n\n![](/assets/images/2021-02-25-14-20-08.png)\n\nand select chemical compound (i.e. [Q11173](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q11173)):\n\n![](/assets/images/2021-02-25-14-20-58.png)\n\nClick ```publish``` to save your changes and make them public.\n\nSince you created a new item about an instance of a chemical compound, the user interface will automatically propose to you a set of additional statements commonly found on items about chemical compounds.\n\n![](/assets/images/2021-02-25-14-22-44.png)\n\nYou can then go on and fill these in.\n\nHere, we start with the InChIKey. \nNote the little flag which will automatically tell you if you have some problems with the recently created statements.\n\n![](/assets/images/2021-02-25-14-24-34.png)\n\nHere, Wikidata tells us that if we add an InChiKey, we will need to also add an InChI. Logical, but good to have a reminder !\n\nLet's go ahead and add the InChI string.\n\nLikewise, the addition of an isomeric SMILES string will require us to add a Canonical SMILES.\n\nNote that you might have to copy and paste the SMILES string from PubChem to a plain text editor and then back to Wikidata because of some formatting issues when copy pasting directly from PubChem.\n\n```\nC[C@@H]1C2[C@]([C@H]3[C@H]4[C@]1(C5=CC(=C(Cl)Cl)[C@@H]([C@]5([C@@H]([C@@]6([C@H]4O6)COC(=O)C)OC(=O)C)O)OC(=O)C7=CC=CC=C7)OC(O3)(O2)C8=CC=CC=C8)(C(=C)C)O\n\nCC1C2C(C3C4C1(C5=CC(=C(Cl)Cl)C(C5(C(C6(C4O6)COC(=O)C)OC(=O)C)O)OC(=O)C7=CC=CC=C7)OC(O2)(O3)C8=CC=CC=C8)(C(=C)C)O\n```\n\n### Add the biological source information <a name=\"add_bio\"></a>\n\nNow let's add the ```found in taxon``` property ([P703](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P703)).\n\nJust click on ```Add a new statement``` and type in the first letters of the property you want to add:\n\n![](/assets/images/2021-02-25-14-31-56.png)\n\nAgain, type in the first letters of the taxon, and if the organism is present, it will autocomplete. Here is how this looks like for _Trigonostemon cherrieri_:\n\n![](/assets/images/2021-02-25-14-33-14.png)\n\nClick ```publish``` to save your changes and make them public.\n\n\nIf your target taxon is not yet present on Wikidata and you are sure you have a valid taxon name that is spelled correctly, then you can go to [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:NewItem](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:NewItem), as described in the [Add your data manually to Wikidata](#add_your_data_manually) section. For items about taxa, the ```instance of``` statement should have a value ```taxon``` (i.e. [Q16521](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q16521)). As for chemical compounds, the user interface will then suggest to you further statements to add. For taxa, these include taxon name, parent taxon and taxon rank.\n\n\n### Add the reference documenting the structure-organism pair <a name=\"add_ref\"></a>\n\nFinally, since we report documented structure-organisms pairs, we need to add the reference for this newly created ```compound found in taxon``` relationship.\nThis happens on the item about the compound, just below the ```found in taxon``` statement. Click on the ```0 references``` link and then on ```add reference```:\n\n![](/assets/images/2021-02-25-14-35-33.png)\n\nHere, we use the ```stated in``` property ([P248](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P248)):\n\n![](/assets/images/2021-02-25-14-36-33.png)\n\nNow, type in the first letters or word of the scientific publication documenting the natural product occurence, autocompletion happens again. Note that multiple publications might have the same title, and that there could be minor differences in punctuation or special characters between the information you and Wikidata have about the same reference. If you are not sure whether your target reference is already in Wikidata, you can use its DOI to check, as outlined in the [Check whether your target reference is already on Wikidata](#check_ref) section.\n\n![](/assets/images/2021-02-25-14-38-54.png)\n\nClick ```publish``` to save your changes and make them public.\n\n![](/assets/images/2021-02-25-14-39-48.png)\n\n### Check whether your target reference is already on Wikidata <a name=\"check_ref\"></a>\n\nIf you are not sure whether your target reference is already in Wikidata, you can use its DOI to check. For our DOI ```10.1021/ol2030907```, the URL [https://scholia.toolforge.org/doi/___10.1021/ol2030907___](https://scholia.toolforge.org/doi/10.1021/ol2030907) will lead you to a [Scholia](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Scholia) page about this publication: [https://scholia.toolforge.org/work/Q83059010](https://scholia.toolforge.org/work/Q83059010). Scholia visualizes information from Wikidata, so if it has an entry for your target reference, then so does Wikidata, and both of them will use the same identifier (in this case [Q83059010](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q83059010)). If you prefer to resolve your DOI to Wikidata directly, you can do so by using the uppercase-normalized DOI in the following URL pattern: [https://hub.toolforge.org/P356:**10.1021/OL2030907**](https://hub.toolforge.org/P356:10.1021/OL2030907), which will lead you to the respective Wikidata page, in this case [Q83059010](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q83059010).\n\nIf you think that no Wikidata entry exists for your target reference, you can use the DOI in the URL pattern [https://sourcemd.toolforge.org/index_old.php?id=**10.1021/ol2030907**&doit=Check+source](https://sourcemd.toolforge.org/index_old.php?id=10.1021/ol2030907&doit=Check+source), which will trigger a check with both Crossref and Wikidata, and if no Wikidata entry can be found, the metadata from Crossref will be fetched and presented to you for creating the respective Wikidata item semi-automatically. Using such semi-automated workflows does require and account that is a minimum number of days old and has made a minimum number of edits on Wikidata.\n\nIf you are interested the annotation of article with topics in Scholia here is a tutorial [https://laurendupuis.github.io/Scholia_tutorial/](https://laurendupuis.github.io/Scholia_tutorial/)\n\n\n## Voila !\n\nYou have added your first documented structure-organism relationship to Wikidata and made a valuable contribution to the community.\nYou can add further statements, e.g. ```molecular formula```, or ```SPLASH code``` for linking to spectral data.\n\nThe Wikidata entry [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q105674316](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q105674316) has been started using these instructions.\n\nYou can run a SPARQL query and

Emergence hence is creation of new properties regardless of the substance involved.\n\n\nBut these system builders' discussions are very important, and they are one of the main reasons that the concept of emergence was \"devitalized\", that is, deprived of an immaterial causal agent.\n\n\nEmergence is among other things the concept which relate levels to each other - or to be more precise, the concept which denotes the very passage between them. It does not in itself solve anything, but it poses the problem in a general way, making it visible at the border of every specialized branch of science\n\n\nIn Lloyd Morgan's definition of emergence as \"creation of new properties\" there are three key words: \"properties\", \"new\" and \"creation\". By a more detailed discussion of these key concepts, it is possible to grasp the primary topics in the concept of emergence.\n\n- properties\n\nsecond, and more commonly used definition, tells us that emergence is at stake at the borders between the large sciences: where the explanatory power of one science must give in, another must take over at the level of the hitherto unexplainable - emergent - property. But it is not possible to restrict emergence to these borders. As already Morgan realized, the science usually considered more basic than all others - physics - in itself contains numerous cases of emergence.\n\n\n- novelty\n- creation\n","n":0.055}}},{"i":70,"$":{"0":{"v":"Nginx","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n# Title \n2022-11-02 14:42\n## Context\nLooking into nginx to setup a connection to NocoDB from the commons_lab server \n\nThis was done on the metabomaps server for the graphDB instance with the help of Jo.\nTrying to reproduce here.\n## Need\nsetup a connection to NocoDB from the commons_lab server\n\n## Task (of the note/paragraph/text/paper/project)\nThird, indicate what you have done in an effort to address the need (this is the task).\n- [ ] Watching https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKxlsvZXG7c\n\nThey indicate that the conf file is usually under etc/nginx.\nIndeed over there on the metabomaps server.\n\nLets looks at the commonslab server\nNot there.\n\nLets install this\n\nFollowing https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-and-configure-nginx#2-installing-nginx\n\n\nWe get the following error when starting nginx \n\n(base) allardpm@biolpc045600:/etc/nginx/sites-enabled$ systemctl status nginx.service\n● nginx.service - A high performance web server and a reverse proxy server\n     Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/nginx.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)\n     Active: failed (Result: exit-code) since Sun 2022-06-19 09:06:20 CEST; 57s ago\n       Docs: man:nginx(8)\n    Process: 3544101 ExecStartPre=/usr/sbin/nginx -t -q -g daemon on; master_process on; (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS)\n    Process: 3544102 ExecStart=/usr/sbin/nginx -g daemon on; master_process on; (code=exited, status=1/FAILURE)\n\n\nFollowing https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51525710/nginx-failed-to-start-a-high-performance-web-server-and-a-reverse-proxy-server\n\n\nsudo systemctl reload nginx\n\n\nwe \n sudo service apache2 stop\n\n\n ![](/assets/images/2022-06-19-09-11-18.png)\n\n Amazing !\n\n\n \n- [ ] So this was a first step.\nApparently certbot was used later one.
