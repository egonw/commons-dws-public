Can I launch a project outside of the United States?
We currently support projects that wish to receive their funds to a bank account in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, and Australia. If you are conducting your research in another country, but have a bank account in one of our supported countries, you are eligible.

We intend to support researchers regardless of their bank account currency, but we are not there yet.
