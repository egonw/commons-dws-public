# Title

## Context
Looking into nginx to setup a connection to NocoDB from the commons_lab server 

This was done on the metabomaps server for the graphDB instance with the help of Jo.
Trying to reproduce here.
## Need
setup a connection to NocoDB from the commons_lab server

## Task (of the note/paragraph/text/paper/project)
Third, indicate what you have done in an effort to address the need (this is the task).
- [ ] Watching https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKxlsvZXG7c

They indicate that the conf file is usually under etc/nginx.
Indeed over there on the metabomaps server.

Lets looks at the commonslab server
Not there.

Lets install this

Following https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-and-configure-nginx#2-installing-nginx


We get the following error when starting nginx 

(base) allardpm@biolpc045600:/etc/nginx/sites-enabled$ systemctl status nginx.service
● nginx.service - A high performance web server and a reverse proxy server
     Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/nginx.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
     Active: failed (Result: exit-code) since Sun 2022-06-19 09:06:20 CEST; 57s ago
       Docs: man:nginx(8)
    Process: 3544101 ExecStartPre=/usr/sbin/nginx -t -q -g daemon on; master_process on; (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS)
    Process: 3544102 ExecStart=/usr/sbin/nginx -g daemon on; master_process on; (code=exited, status=1/FAILURE)


Following https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51525710/nginx-failed-to-start-a-high-performance-web-server-and-a-reverse-proxy-server

we 
 sudo service apache2 stop

 Amazing !


 
- [ ] So this was a first step.
Apparently certbot was used later one. Lets see how this one works

https://certbot.eff.org/instructions?ws=nginx&os=ubuntufocal

I added the ip of the commons lab server to the dbgi DNS
And can now vie the previously made placeholder website when serving on port 80

![](/assets/images/2022-06-19-09-43-57.png)

However the certbot step is not working 
sudo certbot --nginx

And returns 


https://check-your-website.server-daten.de/?q=commons.dbgi.org



![](/assets/images/2022-06-19-10-53-34.png)

Yeah !! But thats on the metabomaps server. Apparently thing will not work that smoothly on the commons server sinc it is behind the university firewall
running (saved as a .sh script)
 certbot --authenticator standalone --installer nginx   -d xxxxxxx.xxxx.org --pre-hook "service nginx stop" --post-hook "service nginx start"




- [ ] So I can serve the nocodb instance hosted on the commonslab server via a .dbgi.org domains

nginx server file is as follows

server {
       listen 80;
       listen [::]:80;

       server_name xxxxx.dbgi.org;

  # If you would like to gzip your stuff
  gzip on;
  gzip_min_length 1;
  gzip_types *;

  # Setup the proxy
  # This will forward all requests to the server
  # and then it will relay the servers response back to the client
  location / {
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080;
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
  }
}

## serving the directus interface

port 8055

sudo certbot --authenticator standalone --installer nginx -d directus.dbgi.org --pre-hook "service nginx stop" --post-hook "service nginx start"

Problem : 

Saving debug log to /var/log/letsencrypt/letsencrypt.log
Requesting a certificate for directus.dbgi.org

Certbot failed to authenticate some domains (authenticator: standalone). The Certificate Authority reported these problems:
  Domain: directus.dbgi.org
  Type:   dns
  Detail: DNS problem: NXDOMAIN looking up A for directus.dbgi.org - check that a DNS record exists for this domain; DNS problem: NXDOMAIN looking up AAAA for directus.dbgi.org - check that a DNS record exists for this domain

Hint: The Certificate Authority failed to download the challenge files from the temporary standalone webserver started by Certbot on port 80. Ensure that the listed domains point to this machine and that it can accept inbound connections from the internet.

Of course it doesn't work as we need to declare the DNS first at our DNS provider interface lets go ther 
It needs to be opened 

Done

Then copied the nocodb in /etc/nginx/sites-enabled and changed the server name

Certbox command is still not OK but different error.
Website is accessible

### Checking nginx status

`systemctl status nginx`

on metabomaps it keeps falling.Here is an error message

● nginx.service - A high performance web server and a reverse proxy server
   Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/nginx.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
   Active: failed (Result: exit-code) since Mon 2022-10-17 19:05:49 UTC; 2 weeks 1 days ago
     Docs: man:nginx(8)

  Process: 4656 ExecStart=/usr/sbin/nginx -g daemon on; master_process on; (code=exited, status=1/FAILURE)

This is runned to check the nginy conf

sudo nginx -t

nginx: [warn] conflicting server name "graph.metabomaps.com" on 0.0.0.0:80, ignored
