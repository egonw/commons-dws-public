## Daily report (What did I learn?)
Github actions had problems with publishing the website. So I tried to fix it and found out, that the action was failing because of a "missing package: mkdocstring". Even after adding it the action with the command `mkdocs gh-deploy` was failing.

"mkdocstrings" is set as plugin in the mkdocs.yml file. Somehow he couldn't find a specific module. Even after adding the mkdocstrings package. It can be interesting to dive more in too. <https://mkdocstrings.github.io/>
I also don't understand exactly how it works with sphynx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/>, which I mostly can find...
 (pytkdocs)
