# This is PMAS's COMMONS Lab daily open-notebook.

Today is 2023.02.10

## Todo today

### Have a look at the XXXX discussion forum
    - https://github.com/orgs/XXXXX/discussions

## Doing

- refactoring traits and templates so as to have the possibility to generate daily open-notebooks notes across all public and private Dendrons. 
Let's see if the fact to have a common `open-notebook.`hierarchy cross Dendron workspace doesn't leads to conflicts.

Apparently this implies to copy individual Dendron's Note traits to the Multiworkspace Dendron but shortcuts can be shared.




## Paused

## Done

## Notes

- Checked the GNPS + metabolite annotation with Stephanie this morning.

It would be good to have a list of Anacardiaceae metabolites.

1.  Download - Datawarrior (https://openmolecules.org/datawarrior/)
2. Download and uncompress - https://zenodo.org/record/7534071#.Y-YjcZOZP8Y 230106_frozen_metadata.csv.gz
3. load 230106_frozen_metadata.csv.gz in DW
4. save as .dwar
5. search and filter for Anacardiaceae
6. search and filter for each of your plants





## Todo tomorrow
