# This is Marco's daily open-notebook.

Today is 2023.02.09

## Todo today

### Have a look at the DBGI discussion forum
* https://github.com/orgs/digital-botanical-gardens-initiative/discussions


###
###

## Doing
* comment code from https://github.com/anticipated-lotus/elotus-trees
  * `prepare_pseudoabsence_tables.R`
  * `prettyStructuresTable.R`
  * `prettyTree.R`

## Paused

## Done
Commented code from https://github.com/anticipated-lotus/elotus-trees : 
* `count_npclasses.R`
* `papers_taxa_correlation.R`

## Notes
### Scripts descrition
I think the most important script for us is `prepare_pseudoabsence_tables.R`. It generates presence and absence tables
of chemical compounds based on the Order. The Order could be changed to then have tables based on Family, Subfamily, Genus, etc... 

This will have to be discussed: 
* At what level of taxonomy do we want to work ?
* At what level of *chemical* taxonomy should we work ? 
* Should we try all the levels ?
