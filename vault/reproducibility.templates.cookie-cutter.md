Tired of having non consistent folder for MAPP Metabolomics reports.
Looking into cookie cutter (for data science) as a possible template to start with and have more consistency across these repos.

Using the github template is allready a good start maybe https://levelup.gitconnected.com/quick-setup-of-data-science-github-repositories-647b111b3c5f
