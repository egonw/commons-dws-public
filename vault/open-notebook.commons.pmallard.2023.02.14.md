Q: Hi Katrin. Thanks for the talk ! On one slide you mentioned the importance of efforts regarding integration of omics data within the SPHN KG.
Are these future tasks or are they currently undertaken ? I am particularly interested to know wether they are concrete things done on the integration of metabolomics data.
What are the challenges here according to you ?

National Data streams.

Integration of genomics + other omics
Two of them integrate metabolomics data Partners on the data stream. Curated with an expert team in Zurich

Who are these teams ?

### Check how to setup granular autorization on a git organizations

### Discussion with Marco

Why should molecules be normaly distributed  ?
Have a look why object in Nature are usually normally distributed ? Are they exceptions ? 

near field NMR ?

https://github.com/mandelbrot-project/pf_1600_datanote

todo PM : 
- prepare the 1600 pf dataset 
- prepare DBGI

MS paper Marco

### ENPKG

- have the 1600 pf dataset ind files uploaded on Zenodo
- Think about a structure for individual "capsule" per profile. 
It would include all required metdata, raw files and resulting individual RDF
Could be uploaded to Zenop using their API. 
Each profiled sample wpould thus benefit from its individual doi

Q: what wouldn't fit in such a capsule ?




## Todo tomorrow, another day ... or never !
### Mechanism to copy assets
When transfering daily notes from notebook.xxxx. to open-notebook.xxxx the assets stay in the orignal vault where they were pasted. This leads to broken link.

## Today I learned that

- 
```R 
glimpse(df)
```
is a great way to peak into a df

Added to [[R]]
