# PAMREIN's daily Open Notebook (COMMONS Lab)

## Todo - [Check Github](https://github.com/orgs/commons-research/projects/2/views/1)
-[]


## Meetings
Today I will try to setup duckdb to search the database.



## Daily report (What did I learn?)
the tests for duckDB

srun --partition=pibu_el8 --cpus-per-task=6 --mem=600G --time=10:00:00 --pty /bin/bash

The worker died unexpectedly while executing this task. Check python-core-worker-*.log files for more information.  

Because of this error, the memory and cpu was increased to cpus-per-task=10 and mem=900G
