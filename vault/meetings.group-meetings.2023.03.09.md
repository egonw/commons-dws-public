## Lëndita

- Switch from the "cutting" pilot to testing the effects of repeated freeze-drying cycle.
- Take Datawarrior to explore the https://github.com/digital-botanical-gardens-initiative/taxonomical-preparator/blob/main/data/out/species_list_croisee_final.csv 
This can be used for preparing plots (e.g. what is the taxonomical composition of the Serre 1 ?)
