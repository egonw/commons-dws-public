La liberté académique est la base de la recherche et de l'enseignement. Elle consiste en “the right to freely define research questions, choose and develop theories, gather empirical material and employ sound academic research methods, to question accepted wisdom and bring forward new ideas. It entails the right to share, disseminate and publish the results thereof openly, including through training and teaching. It is the freedom of researchers to express their opinion without being disadvantaged by the system in which they work or by governmental or institutional censorship and discrimination.” Bonn declaration on freedom of academic research, Adopted at the Ministerial Conference on the European Research Area on 20 October.
