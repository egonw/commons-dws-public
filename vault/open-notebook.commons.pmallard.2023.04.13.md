# This is PMAS's COMMONS Lab daily Open Notebook.

Today is 2023.04.13

## Todo today

### Have a look at the COMMONS research discussion forum
    - https://github.com/orgs/commons-research/discussions

## Doing

### Metabolite annotation Audrey and Stephanie

Annotation with https://github.com/mandelbrot-project/met_annot_enhancer




## Paused

## Done

## Notes

## Eclipta alba


- Culture of non native plants ([Eclipta alba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eclipta_prostrata "Eclipta prostrata, commonly known as false daisy, yerba de tago, Gunta kalagaraku\/Gunta galagaraku, Karisalankanni, and bhringraj, is a species of plant in the family Asteraceae. It is widespread across much of the world.This plant has cylindrical, grayish roots. Solid, circular, purplish stems with white fine hairs 0.8m. Leaves arranged in opposite pairs, hairy in two-sided, lanceolate, serrated 2–12.5 cm long, 5-35 mm wide.
The solitary flower heads are 6–8 mm \(0.24–0.31 in\) in diameter, with white florets. The bumpy achenes are compressed and narrowly winged. This species grows commonly in moist places in warm temperate to tropical areas worldwide. It is widely distributed throughout India, Nepal, China, Thailand,Bangladesh and Brazil."))



Presence of [coumestan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coumestan "Coumestan is a heterocyclic organic compound.  Coumestan forms the central core of a variety of natural compounds known collectively as coumestans.  Coumestans are oxidation products of pterocarpan that are similar to coumarin.  Coumestans, including coumestrol, a phytoestrogen, are found in a variety of plants. Food sources high in coumestans include split peas, pinto beans, lima beans, and especially alfalfa and clover sprouts.Coumestrol has about the same binding affinity for the ER-β estrogen receptor as 17β-estradiol, but much less affinity than 17α-estradiol, although the estrogenic potency of coumestrol at both receptors is much less than that of 17β-estradiol.Because of the estrogenic activity of some coumestans, a variety of syntheses have been developed that allow the preparation of coumestans so that their pharmacological effects can be explored.") 


5 enzymatic test (COX, elastase, ROS etc.)

Q : why such difference in the raw extracts conc used for testing ?
Q : can you explain the heatmap again ?
Q : stats significative diff 
Q : how did you annotate the compounds ? Which software ? Which DB ?



## C forskohlii 

[Coleus forskohlii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coleus_barbatus "Coleus barbatus, also known by the synonyms Plectranthus barbatus and incorrectly Coleus forskalaei \(and other spellings of this epithet\), is a tropical perennial plant related to the typical coleus species.  It produces forskolin, an extract useful for pharmaceutical preparations and research in cell biology. ")

[forskolin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forskolin "Forskolin \(coleonol\) is a labdane diterpene produced by the plant Coleus barbatus \(Blue Spur Flower\). Other names include pashanabhedi, Indian coleus, makandi, HL-362, mao hou qiao rui hua. As with other members of the large diterpene class of plant metabolites, forskolin is derived from geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate \(GGPP\). Forskolin contains some unique functional elements, including the presence of a tetrahydropyran-derived heterocyclic ring. Forskolin is commonly used in laboratory research to increase levels of cyclic AMP by stimulation of adenylate cyclase.")

which gave the name to the plant ?

How do you quantify forskolin iteratively ?


### Conclusion 

explore the coumestan biosynthetic pathway.
Why exactly ?


### Perspectives and collab in UniFr
